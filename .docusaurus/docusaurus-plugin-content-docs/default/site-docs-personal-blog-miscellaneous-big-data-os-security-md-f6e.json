  "description": "A major portion of the worldâ€™s population now has Internet access, with the number of connected devices currently in the billions. The decline in the cost of hardware resources, especially the cost of storage devices, is one factor that enables organizations to store every bit of data, leading to the accumulation of data in volumes unimaginable. Traditional network perimeter defense systems become ineffective in resisting targeted attacks as they are not scalable to the size of organizational networks.",
