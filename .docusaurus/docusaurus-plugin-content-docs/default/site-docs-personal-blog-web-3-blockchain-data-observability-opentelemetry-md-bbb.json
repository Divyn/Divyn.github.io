  "description": "You're running a Solana trading bot that depends on real-time, low-latency price feeds. Suddenly, your dashboard shows stale data from 5 minutes ago. Is it a network issue? An API problem? Did your application crash? Or is it just Solana's network congestion? Without proper insight into what happened or where everything went wrong, you're flying blind â€” which, in crypto, equals losing money. What's more, you need to make sure that you are notified if this issue repeats itself.",
