#Showdown

The entire sky was mourning the death of my imagination.
People believe that God will give you what you ask. If so, why hasn't nothing changed yet for me? Maybe I didn't pray loud enough for it to reach the skies.

The dining table was as quiet as a graveyard, the sound of the spoon clashing with the plate was the only sound that was heard.

"Did you cry for a long time yesterday?"

It is a pity that they can see through me so clearly, and yet they have no consideration for what it does to my pride and my heart.
I wanted to hide under the table so badly.
But I didn't move, neither did I answer her question.
A part of me was angry with my sister, and with myself for sharing my request with her.
The very reason I kept postponing the talk was to find a way to avoid everything happening now.

They say anger leads to delusion, and delusion leads to confusion which  in turn ruins our ability to reason, like a domino ultimately destroying our lives.

If that's true, then I am already halfway through.
