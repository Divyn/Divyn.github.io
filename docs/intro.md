## Welcome to My Portfolio!

Before you explore the sidebar, let me share a little about my journey.

Every job, every task I've taken up has taught me something new. Learning has been a constant, and each experience has shaped the way I work today.

## üè¢ From Salesforce Developer to Tech Storyteller

### **Starting Out at VMware**
My career began as a **Salesforce Developer at VMware**‚Äîmy first job straight out of college. It was an incredible experience where I learned what it means to be a small cog in a large machine. More importantly, I discovered how **enterprise software** operates:

- The deployment process and production releases  
- Making changes, testing, and working with QA teams  
- Details matter
- VERY Clear communication  
- Resolving conflicts and collaborating with business analysts  
- Understanding how product teams define and deliver solutions  

A major portion of my professional foundation was built during this role.

### **Exploring Beyond Development**
After **2.5 years**, I felt the urge to explore. I quit my job and transitioned into **technical content writing** as a freelancer. 

During this phase, I took up various **technical content gigs**, including writing sales copies for a company. This experience gave me a fresh perspective on **developer communication, marketing, and storytelling**.

## üöÄ Stepping Into Blockchain & Developer Relations

### **Joining Bitquery**
Next came an exciting shift‚ÄîI joined **Bitquery** as a **Developer Relations Engineer**. 

**Blockchain?** At the time, I knew very little beyond my personal interest in crypto. But I took on the challenge, and this role taught me **everything**:

- Writing clear and precise **technical documentation**
- Supporting and engaging **developer communities**
- Understanding **how blockchain networks function**  
- Analyzing on-chain data and **market trends**
- Exploring smart contracts and building on different blockchains  

I can now look at blockchain data and **tell exactly what‚Äôs happening across multiple chains**. I understand the infrastructure, data structures, use cases, and how different networks operate.
