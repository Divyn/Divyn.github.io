## Welcome to My Portfolio!

Before you explore the sidebar, let me share a little about my journey.

Every job, every task I've taken up has taught me something new. Learning has been a constant, and each experience has shaped the way I work today.

## 🏢 From Salesforce Developer to Tech Storyteller

### **Starting Out at VMware in 2020**

My career began as a **Salesforce Developer at VMware**—my first job straight out of college. It was an incredible experience where I learned what it means to be a small cog in a large machine. More importantly, I discovered how **enterprise software** operates:

- The deployment process and production releases
- Making changes, testing, and working with QA teams
- Details matter
- VERY Clear communication
- Resolving conflicts and collaborating with business analysts
- Understanding how product teams define and deliver solutions

A major portion of my professional foundation was built during this role.

### **Exploring Beyond Development**

After **2.5 years**, I felt the urge to explore. I quit my job and transitioned into **technical content writing** as a freelancer.

During this phase, I took up various **content gigs**, including writing sales copies for an advertising company.

## 🚀 Stepping Into Blockchain & Developer Relations

### **Joining Bitquery in 2023**

Next came an exciting shift—I joined **Bitquery** as an **early support/docs writer/polymath**.

**Blockchain?** At the time, I knew very little beyond my personal interest in crypto. But I took on the challenge, and this role taught me **everything**:

- Writing usable **technical documentation**
- Supporting **any developer who comes with questions on using Bitquery**
- Analyzing **on-chain data**
- Getting Bitquery to #1 on Google search, ChatGPT for 100s of onchain/crypto API/stream keywords
- Picking up new stuff in a day or two,for example, **building data pipelines with Kafka** or **negotiating a partnership with another web3 team**

I can now look at blockchain data and **tell exactly what’s happening across multiple chains**. I understand the infrastructure, data structures, use cases, and how different networks operate.

## 💡 A Lifelong Learner

At every job, I’ve **learned on the job**—throwing myself into challenges, knowing that I’d come out stronger.

### Part-time Postgrad Journey

I am currently doing my masters online at UIUC 🎉 focusing on business/economics/management and obsessed with the subject of Infonomics.

I believe in **learning fast, adapting, and contributing** as much as possible. If you decide to work with me, I assure you—it will be a decision you won’t regret. 🚀
