# Basics of Design Research

- The study of consumer behavior is one of the most common examples of research in design.
-  *Context* is understanding everything relevant to a design problem. It's a general awareness of the user, their needs, wants, and motivations. And also their environment, what it looks like, sounds like, feels like, and more. Without some degree of accurate information, your solution will be nothing more than a best guess. 

### Be a Better Designer

  Design with an understanding of context, focus more on their user and their experiences with what you're designing. Support and validate your decisions through actual evidence, not your own or others' subjective thinking. Broaden your capabilities by becoming a strategist and collaborate with other disciplines. 

### "The Strategic Designer" by David Holston
A new designer must possess the following four qualities. 
- They must embrace complexity.
-  They must be collaborative. 
- They must design in context. 
- They must be accountable.
