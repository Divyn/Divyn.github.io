# Sales Automation - An Introduction

Generating leads for your company is the first stage of the sales cycle. Any product improvements may have prompted several leads to visit your website. Others may have quickly skimmed your website to see whether you are providing what they need. You'll save a lot of time if you can swiftly collect the lead information when they visit your product website or landing pages. 

By reducing the time spent on administration and reporting, sales automation has the ability to lower the cost of sales. It also has the potential to increase revenue by automating outreach to clients who are already in the sales funnel.

Sales automation, roughly put is any technology that may mimic human cognitive abilities like logical reasoning, pattern recognition, and so forth, hence decreasing manual labour in a particular sales process. This is achieved by the use of technologies including but not limited to machine learning (ML), robotic process automation (RPA), natural language processing/generation (NLP), smart workflows, and virtual agents are the five technologies that are fundamental to sales automation initiatives.

According to Mckinsey's Marketing & Sales Insights Report, the chain can automate more than 30% of activities related to sales.

## There are several use cases along the entire sales value chain.

 Listed below are two such instances.

### Prioritize leads automatically:
You can create rules to identify leads that match particular characteristics and give them a higher quality score. Therefore, you have a prioritized list of leads that should be pursued first.


### Analytics and Reporting:
To fully understand what is working and what isn't in the sales chain, we require a closed-loop reporting system. This process can be automated by getting periodic sales reports as often as you'd like to your email. You can subscribe to a variety of sales reports, including those on task completion, revenue targets, sales performance, and funnel status.
