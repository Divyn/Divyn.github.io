# The Use of Data Analytics: Where does it stand?

## Current Status

Today's workplaces rely heavily on dashboards and visualizations, which provide users with pre-built reports and filters to track performance metrics immediately.

Despite the perceived ease of use of today's analytics tools, organizations have trouble preparing, assimilating and comprehending their data, much less putting it to use.

## The barriers to mass adoption

The fact that all of the data are kept on separate sources, come from different end points, and need to be handled in various ways is another issue with how the data are currently being used.

As a saviour to this problem appears the design concept of data fabric.

Data fabric is an emerging data management design that enables data integration and sharing across heterogeneous data sources. Data fabrics have emerged as an increasingly popular design choice to simplify an organizationâ€™s data integration infrastructure and create a scalable architecture.

In a nutshell, data fabric makes it possible for applications to access and manipulate data from multiple sources without requiring any changes to the source code (or vendor).

## Is it still a booming industry?

Although privacy is a top worry, analytics is still a disruptive force in the industry.

According to [Market Research Future report](https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/data-analytics-market-1689), the global analytics market is all set to hit $132,903.8 million by 2026. Lot of companies have grown as much as [1011%](https://explodingtopics.com/topic/databricks) in search with many companies applying for IPO (e.g., LatentView Analytics).

The global analytics market is currently dominated by large companies such as Google and Amazon, but this is likely to change in future since there are a number of start-ups that have emerged over the past few years and are gearing up for a big chunk of the market share.
