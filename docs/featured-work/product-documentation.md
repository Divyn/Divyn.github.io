# Product Documentation

- [**Tutorial | Blockchain Data Platform (V1)**](https://docs.bitquery.io/v1/)  
  I was one of the first team members working on this. Along with my colleague, I helped build the V1 documentation from the ground up, and supported both the product and marketing teams.

- [**Tutorial | Data Streaming Platform**](https://docs.bitquery.io/)  
   I handle a big part of this, like adding new APIs, doing SEO and SEM, keeping the schema up to date, and maintaining the overall structure and documentation.

- [**Coinpath Product**](https://bitquery.io/products/coinpath)  
  This is one of several pages I've worked on. I manage a website designer who builds each page based on our needs.
