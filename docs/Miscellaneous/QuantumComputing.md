# Quantum Computing: One Step Closer to Achieving 2030 Sustainability Goals

## Introduction
By 2030, the world’s governments have committed to achieving net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases. Meeting the goal of zero emissions requires huge advances in climate technology that now we can’t achieve at scale.
Achieving sustainable development goals like the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Climate Agreement will require technological advances like quantum computing technology.
Quantum computers could bring about changes in materials, chemical processes and energy delivery systems that would enable us to address global challenges more efficiently and effectively than we currently can.
Below are a few examples of how companies are utilizing quantum computing to achieve these development goals.

## Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7): Affordable, Reliable and Modern Energy for All
### Batteries:
To achieve zero-carbon electrification, batteries are essential.
In recent research, quantum computing was shown to be capable of simulating the chemistry of batteries in ways that aren't currently possible.
IBM and Daimler AG have begun work on using quantum computer to model next generation lithium sulfur (Li-S) batteries capable of delivering higher power, longer lifespan and lower cost than lithium-ion batteries.

### Construction Industry:
In order to keep up with the growing demand, construction companies are constantly looking for new ways to improve their efficiency and cut down on time. This can be difficult because there are so many different variables to be considered when designing a building or other structure. 
BosonQ Psi is one of the startups in quantum computing industry. They use quantum simulations to provide better solutions for more than one use case in this industry.
Sensors for Hazard Detection:  A quantum sensor is an ultra-sensitive sensor that is more effective and efficient than existing technologies. Using magnetism sensors, small changes in the quality of metals used in construction can be detected.
Several companies are developing quantum sensors that detect deep-underground hazards faster and more accurately, such as sinkholes, mineshafts, and landslides. As a result, potential catastrophes can be detected earlier and averted.

### Solar Cells and Smart Energy:
The semiconductor perovskite is a crucial component of solar cells.
Quantum computing could help develop precise simulations of perovskites in all combinations and with different base atoms and doping, leading to higher efficiency, durability, and nontoxic solutions.
The British company Phasecraft is working on modelling new perovskite-silicon photovoltaic materials. Their research has so far produced solar conversion efficiencies exceeding 31%, which is significantly higher than the typical 15-20% attained by silicon cells alone.
With further developments, the technology could move closer to its 43% theoretical efficiency limit.

## SDG 13: Urgent Action to Combat Climate change
### Carbon Capture:
In order to achieve net zero, carbon capture is necessary. Point source and direct—the two main methods in carbon capture could be aided by quantum computing. In order to optimise sorbents for more successful carbon capture and conversion applications, researchers have proposed a method that makes use of quantum computing.

Quantum computing has a lot of promise. It's still in its early days, but we're already seeing major breakthroughs that could have huge implications on everything from cybersecurity to environmental initiatives. We may not yet fully harness the potential of quantum computing, but we do know that it's an extremely useful technology-and the fact that it could solve the problems posed by climate change is an added bonus.
