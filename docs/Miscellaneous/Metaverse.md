A computer scientist in 1991 wrote a book titled Mirror World that imagined a digital world reproducing the real world in appearance of buildings and objects but has its’ own properties and functions.  Known as metaverse in 2022, it's a reality.  It is understandable that the metaverse isn't real, but it can provide a tangible experience. This can be done through the use of immersive user-interactive stories. Remember that the metaverse is "always on" and exists in real-time, so there are numerous opportunities for exploration.
Now that we’ve established the magic of the metaverse, we need to explain why it is needed for the present and the future. One could go on and on about the applications, but let's focus on two areas: simulation and marketing.

 **SIMULATION**

When social distancing separated the world during the Covid19 pandemic, the metaverse technologists collaborated with defence organizations to bring the aerospace industry into the metaverse. The aerospace industry is one of the most influential industries in the world and it has been around for a long time. However, there are many challenges that they have faced over time and this has caused them to stagnate in terms of innovation.
One of these challenges is how difficult it has become for them to build new products due to high costs and regulations. If we can teach the metaverse to learn a modified model within seconds of connecting, imagine how many safety tests we can run without using the air force's infrastructure.

**MARKETING**
 
One of your favourite luxury brand Gucci, opened a store called Gucci Vault that immerses viewers in the fashion house's past, present, and future. This endeavour signalled the start of many brands entry into the cryptoart space.
People who are interested in marketing to Gen Z should identify the platforms that offer the best opportunity and brand fit. There are currently a number of popular metaverse games and platforms on the market, including Roblox, Fortnite, Decentraland, Minecraft, and Meta's Horizon Worlds. Depending on the purpose, some are better than others. There is plenty of room to try out different platforms to find out what works best for you. In order to create engaging marketing experiences, digital marketers should tie them into real-world experiences or parallel the experiences their brand already offers.
The metaverse is best described as an evolution of today's internet—it is something we experience rather than something we observe. It may fulfil the promise of vast digital worlds that parallel our physical world. The metaverse represents an opportunity for marketers to engage consumers in entirely new ways while pushing internal capabilities and brand innovation in new directions.
