# Understanding the SaaS stack for your company

# Why you need to manage your tech stack

As businesses expand, it is not surprising to observe that there are more SaaS in use and that more money is spent on SaaS.

Larger firms tend to use more total apps, i.e., bloatware but a smaller number of unique apps per person.

This leads to a growing reliance on centralised IT and governance; as companies expand, they might tighten up different regulations and procedures and have more room to hire IT specialists internally. The SaaS subscriptions need to be closely monitored, and the centralised management of them defines which apps are accessible to employees.

SaaS waste is a word for subscriptions that are no longer in use. As businesses fail to cancel subscriptions or set up multiple subscriptions for the same app or category, SaaS waste is increasing.

Your licences, whether they are for on-premises software or SaaS software, should be managed with the help of a solid software asset management (SAM) strategy.

# Ã€ la carte approach to building your stack

The use of software suites by organisational teams to meet their demands in the past has been revolutionised by cloud-based software stacks. Suites provided an all-inclusive package of tools for a single cost. Unfortunately, the expansive nature of suites made them difficult to manage.  In comparison, SaaS products that are exclusively built to handle specific challenges provide a competitive edge in terms of focus. You can choose the SaaS offering you want "a la carte" without being forced to purchase the entire suite.

# How to choose the best SaaS tech stack

The following factors are typically taken into consideration when choosing the optimal SaaS tech stack:

- Be sure you comprehend the project's requirements before deciding on a tech stack. Does your app need real-time features like live chat or a chatbot? Is your frontend UI full of complex interactions?
- An active community of developers: To interact and improve a platform or piece of software they are using; developers need a sizable community.
- Less steep learning curve: You do not want to hear the comment "the tech stack is difficult to use." You might want to ask the questions like, how easy is it for an engineer to learn? How easy it to hire developers to match your SaaS tech stack **(Critical).**
- Maintenance cost: The real work startsafter the first iteration of product development is finished. Consider the cost of maintenance and upgrades.
- For any product, time to market is possibly of utmost importance. You will gain more exposure if you build and release your application more quickly. And you get more time to absorb customer feedback.
